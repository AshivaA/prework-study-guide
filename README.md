 # Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I was always curious about how the websites and apps work. But I didnâ€™t have any experience in coding before starting the Bootcamp course and I was really worried about that.  So, I start learning codding by doing prework projects and now I know a bit more about coding like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and GitHub.

Using Prework Study Guide is not too complicated. You can navigate into certain topics like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and GitHub easily. First, you study the Expected Behavior part that gives you a complete overview of what you should study and learn. Then, you do coding step by step in each part and see the result on Dev Tools. Also, if you have experience in codding, the summery part can help you.
